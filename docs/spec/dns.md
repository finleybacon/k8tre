k8tre_statements:
  spec: A TRE that exposes services to consumers outside of its Kubernetes cluster must employ a Kubernetes-native approach for deploying DNS records that allow external consumers to discover these services. The management of these the external DNS entities should be performed together with lifecycle operations, such as deployments or upgrades, of their corresponding services within the TRE.

**Questions**: 

1. **What will provide in-cluster DNS?**

    The default CoreDNS will be suitable for most TRE implementers, since it allows access to services by servicename.namespace without a separate DNS server. A TRE implementer may use a different DNS implementation if it is necessary.
