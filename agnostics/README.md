# K8TRE Agnostics

This directory contains the k8s manifests and related artifacts that will form part of the initial sync wave on any K8TRE cluster.

The resources deployed from here will allow apps running on K8TRE to function agnostic to the underlying Kubernetes/cloud vendor.

These manifests are deployed by the ApplicationSets found in the [/appsets/agnostics/](../appsets/agnostics/) directory.
